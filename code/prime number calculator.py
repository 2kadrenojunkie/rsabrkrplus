#n is the number in which to calculate all prime numbers from 0. i.e. if n = 100 any primes in range 0-100 will be singled out and saved. since the main goal is to factor primes for a given bit length public
#key the number is divided by 2 as it is pointless to calculate any integers that would result in a product larger than the maximum bit length.

#opens prime number file and sets the starting number to the last prime stored. it tests for a empty line ("") as well as ensuring that the number isn't smaller than the last one ensuring incomplete values
#are not used thus ruining progress. pretty inneficient given it checks every single line individually but is not much of a concern personally due to relatively low overall computation needed.
